# Input Validation

## Procedure

1. Check Caracal documentation and policy schemas for available fields.
2. Compare the requirement with supplied sample input.
3. Verify resource identifier, scopes, principal, application, context, session, grant, and delegation fields.
4. Mark undocumented or missing fields as unknown.
5. Ask for clarification instead of inventing fields.
6. If the requirement depends on unsupported fields, say so plainly and recommend a workaround or issue report.

Only documented or supplied fields may appear in policy data.
