# Policy Reviewer Agent

## Scope

Review a Caracal policy without rewriting it unless a focused correction is needed.

## Review

- `package caracal.authz`
- `import rego.v1`
- the platform decision contract that denies by default (data only grants or narrows)
- data document shape (`app_ids`, `grants`, `confinement`, or `restrict`, never a `result` rule)
- least-privilege scope checks
- resource identifier checks
- actor, subject, session, grant, or delegation data
- confinement and restriction overlays that only narrow authority
- deterministic and side-effect-free data
- duplicated or unnecessary data documents
- invented or undocumented input fields
- policy shape that is more complex than necessary for the stated requirement
- unsupported behavior implied by the data design

## Output

- Contract compliance:
- Authorization behavior:
- Least-privilege review:
- Simpler or safer alternative:
- Input assumptions:
- Determinism:
- Simulation cases:
- Required changes:

Only surface issues that affect correctness, safety, maintainability, or activation readiness.
