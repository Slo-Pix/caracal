# Control API bootstrap

Non-interactive zone provisioning through the Caracal **Control API**. This is the
automation answer to "I want a repeatable script that creates a demo
resource/provider/policy on every developer laptop" without adding management
verbs to the runtime CLI.

The runtime CLI stays small on purpose (`up`, `down`, `status`, `purge`, `run`,
`console`). Product management is owned by Console for humans and by the Control
API for automation. Both run the **same engine dispatch**, so a script follows
the exact path a human does in Console — with scopes, replay protection, rate
limiting, and audit on every call.

## Why the Control API instead of a root admin token

Automation does not get the root admin token. It gets a **scoped control key**:

- Zone-bound and application-only (no subject or delegated authority).
- Limited to the exact `control:<command>:<verb>` scopes you allow.
- Short-lived: every call uses a fresh STS token (seconds, not hours).
- Replay-protected, rate-limited, and audited per request.

This keeps least-privilege automation the easy path rather than the exception.

A control key operates **inside its bound zone**. Creating zones stays a Console
operation because a zone is the tenancy boundary the key is scoped to. The STS
resolves that zone from the authenticated key, so the script only needs the
control client id and client secret.

## One-time setup in Console

1. Start the stack and open Console:
   ```bash
   caracal up
   caracal console
   ```
2. In the Control menu, create a control key. Grant only the scopes this script
   needs (provider, resource, and policy read/write/delete). Console returns a
   one-time `client_id` and `client_secret`.
3. Note the control audience only if your deployment overrides the default.

## Run the bootstrap

```bash
cp env.example .env
$EDITOR .env        # fill in CONTROL_CLIENT_ID and CONTROL_CLIENT_SECRET
. .env
npm run bootstrap   # creates the PiperNet provider, resource, and policy
npm run teardown    # removes them again
```

`bootstrap` is idempotent: it skips objects that already exist, so it is safe to
re-run. `teardown` removes the policy, then the resource, then the provider.

## What it provisions

| Object | Identifier | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider | `pipernet-mandate` (`caracal_mandate`) | Upstream authority for the resource, no committed secret. |
| Resource | `resource://pipernet` | Protected API the agent reaches through the Gateway. |
| Policy | `PiperNet baseline` | Allows `read` on the resource. |

To broker a real upstream credential instead, change `PROVIDER` in
`provisionPlan.mjs` to an `api_key` or `oauth2_client_credentials` provider and
supply the secret from the environment. Never commit upstream secrets.

## Files

- `controlClient.mjs` — reusable client: STS client-credentials exchange plus
  `/v1/control/invoke`, with the canonical Control status taxonomy. Copy it into
  your own automation as a starting point.
- `provisionPlan.mjs` — single source of truth for the demo objects, the
  required scopes, and the environment-driven client config.
- `bootstrap.mjs` / `teardown.mjs` — the provisioning and cleanup flows.
- `tests/` — offline tests that pin the request contract against a mock fetch.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

The tests are fully offline; they never call a live Caracal stack.
