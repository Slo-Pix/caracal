// safe fallback exists, a second bearer to retry with if the first is rejected as unrecognized.

// read-only token; a write presents the write token. Either may fall back to the deployment
// admin token if its own token is not recognized, so a not-yet-provisioned or rotated derived
// token never makes a request fail closed — the admin token is the break-glass fallback rather
// than the everyday credential. When a derived token is absent or equal to the admin token there
// is nothing weaker to prefer and no distinct fallback, so the admin token is presented directly.

// — the case a not-yet-provisioned or rotated read token produces. A 403 is a genuine
// authorization denial (the credential is valid but lacks the authority), so it is surfaced
// unchanged rather than retried under broader authority, which would mask a real policy
// outcome. With no distinct fallback there is nothing to retry with.
